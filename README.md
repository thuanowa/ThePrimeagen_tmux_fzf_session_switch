thePrimeage tmux sesssion + switch, list sesssion + new sesssion like https://github.com/thuanowa/tmux-fzf-session-switch

**why?**

show available session name by find working folder is good cuz i didn't need think or type new name for that mean

**what can improve?**

- create custom session name not only available folder, like music session, ssh to stuff session
- search available session, yep easy to switch
